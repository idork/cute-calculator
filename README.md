<h1>The Babble Calculator </h1>

<p>This will be my first project. This calculator will have other features that a normal calculator won't have.
  <ul>
    <li>The -, +, *, %, and = will all make noises when "clicked".</li>
    <li>The calculator will be of a color that is considered "cute"</li>
    <li>This is it so far....</li<>
  </ul>
</p>
